## EXPERIMENT 1 a - DESIGN AND VERIFY THE NAND GATE USING TRANSIENT AND OP ANALYSIS 

## Aim:
To design CMOS NAND gate and perform Transient and Operating Point (OP) analysis.
## Tools Used: 
Virtuoso Schematic Editor is used for the design and analysis. — gpdk045 Technology Library.
## Theory: 
A 2-input CMOS NAND gate is realized using two PMOS transistors in parallel and two NMOS transistors in series.
	When both inputs (A and B) are high, both NMOS conduct, and output goes LOW (0). 
	If either input is low, at least one PMOS conducts, pulling the output HIGH (1).
Thus, output Y=(A⋅B) ‾.
This gate offers low static power consumption and high noise margins like other CMOS logic.

## Procedure:
	Create a new library attached to gpdk045.
	Create a new cell view (e.g., CMOS_NAND).
Place components:
	2 × PMOS transistors (parallel connection)
	2 × NMOS transistors (series connection)
	Input voltage sources (VinA, VinB)
	Ground and VDD (1.8 V typical)
	Connect circuit as per schematic diagram.
Output is taken from the node between PMOS/NMOS network.
